Examples of commands that I use to extract/summarize information from the ouput/logs
after a set of experiments are complete
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# create a listing of the experiment directories used in a run
find ./TEMP -type d | grep "EX" >dirs.txt

#  I usually rename the main experiment directory to the TEMP.X format so
#    that I can use the name TEMP for a new run
find ./TEMP.1 -type d | grep "EX" >dirs.txt

# extracts the parameters and the running time --- see below on examples to
#    sort the output for easier reading
# Also note: despite the caveats in the file, get_exper_stats will work
#    when the directory listings provided are relative rather than absolute
./get_exper_stats.sh ./dirs.txt

# sort the output on the parameter values of interest --- in the example command below, I am assuming
#    that the first three parameters ($1, $2, and $3 in awk) are varied, the next three remain
#    unchanged, and the running time is the seventh field ($7 in awk)
# The awk part here seems unnecessary, but I had trouble getting the multi-field sort to work as
#   expected when the field delimitters were ","
# Note: in the command below, the input to sort has spaces (" ") as field delimitters
./get_exper_stats.sh ./dirs.txt | awk -F, '{print $1 " " $2 " " $3 " " $7}' | sort -n --key=1 --key=2 --key=3
