Description:
-----------
The setup_wiki.sh script will:
(1) download the XML dump of Wikipedia (10/11/2010)
(2) load it into HDFS as XML
(3) convert it into a simple text file
(4) convert it into a block-compressed SequenceFile
(5) build the Wikipedia link graph

Usage:
------
./setup_wiki.sh

Notes:
------
1. The entire process on a 15 c1-medium EC2 node cluster takes about 2 hours
2. The script will download the XML file in the directory /mnt/wiki
3. The script will use the HDFS directory /user/root/wiki/
   The final HDFS directory structure will be:
   /user/root/wiki/txt       -- Contains the simple text file representation
   /user/root/wiki/files     -- Contains the SequenceFile representation
   /user/root/wiki/adjacency -- Contains the adjacency lists of the link graph
