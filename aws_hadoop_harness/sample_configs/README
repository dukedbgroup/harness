config.1.xml and config.5.xml are valid files that you
can use in a command of the following form on a Hadoop 
cluster started on EC2 using the commands in 
hadoop_ec2_contrib_bin provided by the Starfish
project at Duke. 

# Example commands to run on the Hadoop Master node on EC2

perl aws_hadoop_harness/gen_exper.pl aws_hadoop_harness/sample_configs/config.1.xml BASE1

perl aws_hadoop_harness/gen_exper.pl aws_hadoop_harness/sample_configs/config.1.xml BASE2 profile

# Double check that the jar file path in the config.5.xml file is valid
perl aws_hadoop_harness/gen_exper.pl aws_hadoop_harness/sample_configs/config.5.xml BASE3

# Double check that the jar file path in the config.5.xml file is valid
perl aws_hadoop_harness/gen_exper.pl aws_hadoop_harness/sample_configs/config.5.xml BASE4 profile
